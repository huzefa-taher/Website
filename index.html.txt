    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I am a student at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor | GPA: 3.63/4.0 | CS GPA: 3.67/4.0 <br>
      I got my high school Diploma from International Academy East along with my IB Diploma | GPA: 3.9/4.0

    </p>
    <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
    <p>
      My best language is <strong>C++</strong> however I am knowledgeable in a few others such as: 
      <ul><li>C</li> <li>Python</li> <li>C#</li> <li>JavaScript</li> <li>CSS</li> <li>HTML</li> </ul>I am also familiar with <strong>Git/version control</strong> and the <strong>Unity game engine</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <p>
      I have created two games in Unity C#. Both are still work in progress games, but they do function. I created a Platformer game with the help of Wolverine Soft, an organization I am a part of. I have also created a 3D cube runner like game with the help of online tutorials, the credit for the game goes to the Youtuber: brackeys. <br><br>
      On my own, I created a painting app from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Using client X and Y in JavaScript along with a few buttons, the app allows you to draw cool pictures on a yellow canvas with a variety of colors.<br><br>
      I also got some python experience when I made a number writter program. The program took an integer input and then translated the number into words.<br><br>
      Finally, I have created this website from scratch as well. <br><br>
      Along with my personal creations, I have also created a variety of school projects which include a Connect 4 AI along with a forum classification machine learning program. Both were written in C++.
